### Description
A simple puzzle game that has puzzles inside a Joycon and the player solves them by rotating the Joycon in their hand and as well as pressing buttons. Joycon's movements in the game were being replicated from the way it was held and moved the Joycon in the hand.
<br/>
<br/>

### What I worked on:
- Implemented a 3D ball character controller that moves like it's inside the actual Joycon that the player is holding.
- Worked on Joycon vibration that vibrates differently depending on the player's action and the movement.
